üè• AI-Powered Tuberculosis Detection from Chest X-rays

üîç Overview
 This project focuses on the automated detection of Tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images using deep learning and machine learning techniques. Leveraging a publicly available dataset of radiographic images classified as either Normal or Tuberculosis, the system uses a pretrained ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract deep features from each image. These high-dimensional feature vectors are then reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize performance and minimize computational load. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on the reduced features to distinguish between normal and TB-infected lungs. The entire pipeline is integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit web application, allowing users to upload X-ray images and receive instant predictions along with confidence scores. This model provides a lightweight, deployable solution to assist radiologists and healthcare professionals in early TB diagnosis, especially in low-resource settings.

- DenseNet121 CNN for feature extraction
- PCA (100 components) for dimensionality reduction  
- Precision-tuned SVM (12% decision threshold)
- Balanced dataset (700 Normal + 700 TB images)
